## 🏃 Concurrency = Relay Race 🏃

* Only **one runner** runs at a time.
* But the team is working **together toward one goal**.
* Each person waits for their **turn**, and when one finishes, the **baton is passed** to the next.
* They're **not running at the same time**, but their tasks are being **managed in sequence** with good coordination.

> 🧠 **Concurrency = Smart task switching.** Tasks take turns efficiently.

## 👟 Parallelism = Everyone Running Together 🏃🏃🏃🏃

* Imagine **all runners start at once**, each on their **own track**.
* All are **actively working** at the same time.
* You get **maximum speed** because there's no waiting or switching.

> 🧠 **Parallelism = Tasks actually run simultaneously**, using multiple CPUs or cores.

### 🧠 Bonus Comparison Table with Analogy

| Concept         | Real-world Analogy                     | How It Works                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Concurrency** | Relay race (1 runner at a time)        | Tasks take turns efficiently |
| **Parallelism** | 100m race with 4 lanes (everyone runs) | Tasks run at the same time   |

### ✅ Summary

* ✅ **Concurrency** is about **handling** many tasks at once (relay race).
* ✅ **Parallelism** is about **executing** many tasks at the same time (everyone runs).
